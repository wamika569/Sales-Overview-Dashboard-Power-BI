# Sales-Overview-Dashboard-Power-BI
In this project we are designing a dynamic Power BI dashboard that tracks key metrics—Sales, Profit, and Quantity—across four regions: Central, East, South, and West. The dashboard should allow users to filter by year and dynamically switch between the three metrics (Sales, Profit, and Qty) &amp; comparison with Previous year's sales for selected year.
